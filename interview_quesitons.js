// Level 1:

// Write a function named greatThanThree that takes in two numbers and returns true if they are both greater than 3 and false if not.

function greatThanThree (a, b){
  if (a > 3 && b > 3) 
    {return true;}
  else {return false};
}

// Write a function named aOrB that takes in a letter and if it is a or b then return true otherwise return false.

function aORB (letter){
  if (letter == "a" or letter == "b")
    {return true;}
  else {return false;}
}

// Write a function named greatThanTwo that returns true if the number is 2 and false otherwise

function greatThanTwo (number){
  if (number == 2){
    return true;
  }
  else{ return false;}
}

// Level 2:

// eventually you want to be able to do each of these questions on paper in 5 minutes or less

// Write a function named printEvenBetween that takes in two numbers and will return an array of all the even numbers between the given two numbers.

// Write a function named printBetween that takes in two arguments. Assume they are integers. This function will return an array of the numbers between those two arguments.

// Level 3:

// eventually you want to be able to do this question on paper in 10 minutes or less
